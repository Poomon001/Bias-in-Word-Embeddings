1. Explored the SC_WEAT metric.
2. Explored the github repo of the SOTA paper, then adapted their code for our project.
3. Explored OpenAI, GloVE, and FastText embeddings.
4. Compared them wrt SC_WEAT; results are on a spreadsheet for the gender dimension.

24 May 2024
1. Grouped data for future use.
2. Documented setup steps due to lack of instructions on the source GitHub.
3. Explored GloVe and FastText datasets in addition to OpenAI on SC-WEAT.
4. Compared and visualized SC-WEAT distribution results.
5. Analyzed frequency ratio distribution of male and female effect sizes [0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8] for OpenAI, GloVe, and FastText models.
6. **Visualized ratio distribution results.
7. Began big tech analysis.

31 May 2024
1. Crate util: to extract k most frequency word embeddings excluding stop words and punctuations,
   to compute SC-WEAT from word embedding file, to get male/female high effect size
2. Completed Gender Associateion for most frequency words
3. Completed Gender Association by frequency range and effect size
4. Working on clustering (cannot find male high effect size: I think the document is wrong. The code inspection says 0.95 for male)

07 June 2024
1. Imporve and format the code structure so that it is easier to switch between models
2. Finish the cluster method and in the middle of big tech for GloVe 100000
3. Get OpenAI embedded 100000 with filtered words
4. Get OpenAI to work on some methods, but there is still an issue to fix for 100000 words

TO ASK
1. Should I perform data normalization on word embedding? Will it affect our intention to find bias in raw word embeddings?
2. I havent seen data normalization from the paper and didnt normalize data from the raw embedding: e.g fasttext and GloVe etc
3. I can also tokenized word and find mean (baseball = base + ball), shoukd I do that?
4. OS bug: It seems like when I auto concat .csv file with python it replace special english character with Thai
(Solution: I will need to combine excel manully)
(e.g Café => Cafรฉ, für => fรผr, Montréal => Montrรฉal etc)

TODO:
1. Finish Microsoft
2. Concat excel for 7 models
3. Add number to chart
4. Work on BGE
